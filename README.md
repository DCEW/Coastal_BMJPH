This repo is a copy of the analytical code used to produce the published
journal article entitled “Can we empirically derive a geographic
definition of ‘coastal’ for use in cancer data reporting? An ecological
modelling study using England’s national cancer registry.”

The published study can be found at:
<https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjph-2024-001067>

This work was a collaboration between the [National Disease Registration
Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/ndrs) and the University of Liverpool.

# Data sets

We have included here the LSOA-level coastal designations derived from the G_25_5 candidate variable as CSV files here, for ease of update for analytical and operational use.  Both LSOA21 and LSOA11 are made available, to align with the supplementary files (PDF format) suplied by the journal.
